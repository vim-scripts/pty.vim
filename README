Remote terminal support for vim thanks to python.


You need VIM with python support and urxvt (rxvt-unicode) to use this script.
<http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html&gt;

Furthermore this script only provides python functions, so some knowledge about
this (very fine) language is usefull, but not required to benefit from it.

Calling the python function rxvtSend('text','cmd') the first time will spawn
a subprocesses given by the shell command 'cmd' in a new terminal window and
pass 'text' to it. Subsequent calls with the same 'cmd' argument will send further
text to the this subprocess. If you close the terminal window, the child
process stays alive and the next call of 'rxvtSend' opens a new terminal and
connects to it again. If you want to kill the child, call 'rxvtKill()'.
